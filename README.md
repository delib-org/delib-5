# delib-5

## Goal

The objective of Delib 5 is to serve as an inclusive B2C deliberative app, offering a diverse array of deliberation methods.
Deliberation stands as an informed and inclusive mode of discussion dedicated to discovering the most optimal solution for all stakeholders while actively striving to minimize any harm to the interests of those who might be adversely affected by the proposed solution.
